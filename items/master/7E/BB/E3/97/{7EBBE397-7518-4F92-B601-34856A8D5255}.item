While Andrew Frye lay dying on the floor of a Super 8 motel room in Akron, Ohio, last week, a party raged around him.<br>
<br>
The alleged attendees weren&rsquo;t other teenagers but the 16-year-old&rsquo;s own mother and grandmother, police say.
<p>This is another sentence.</p>
<p>
Prosecutors say the very people who should have protected the teenager from the dangers of drug use were the ones who walked him to a ledge and &ldquo;enabled&rdquo; him to jump.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We have evidence of drug abuse by more than one person, more than one relative of the deceased,&rdquo; Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. &ldquo;It appears his mother, her friend and his grandmother, and a friend of the grandmother, all had a hand in obtaining and disseminating heroin among themselves.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The evidence in this case turns my stomach,&rdquo;<strong> Barry</strong> added.</p>
